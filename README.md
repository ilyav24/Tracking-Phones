Angular, Socket.io, Node.JS, PostgreSQL.

Connect as an admin and have clients connect to you. At the push of the button 'get locations' the admin recieves all connected device's locations, displays them conviniently, and saves them to the database.
Admin can then click on each device in the table and see details like latitude, longitude, country, city, ip. 
Also go back and forth between home page, client list and details page.

This took a long time to develop because I was a noob so enjoy!
